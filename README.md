# HotProspect
Hot Prospects is an app to track who you meet at conferences. It shows a QR code that stores your attendee information, then others can scan that code to add you to their list of possible leads for later follow up.

We covered stacks of really important techniques: creating tab bars and context menus, sharing custom data using the environment, sending custom change notifications, and more.
